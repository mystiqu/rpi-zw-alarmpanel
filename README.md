# rpi-zw-alarmpanel

Most video surveillance systems today (google nest, dlink, tplink etc) lacks the functionality to enable/disable the alarm using a classic alarm panel and PIN code. 
This is a vital option for many, not being dependent on activating using the phone since everyone with access to your home might not have a phone. 

Also, using PIN codes you can have a solution where you can create temporary PIN codes for friends or other people who need short term access to your home.

This project is a an attempt at bridging that gap.
